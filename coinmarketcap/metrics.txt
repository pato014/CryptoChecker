CoinMarketCap Scraper Metrics
=============================

Comparison: HTML Scraper vs JSON Scraper

------------------------------------------
1. Lines of Code (LoC)
------------------------------------------
- HTML Scraper (html_scraper.py + run_coinmarketcap_html_scraper.py):
     71 lines
- JSON Scraper (json_scraper.py + run_coinmarketcap_json_scraper.py):
     49 lines

Observation:
- JSON Scraper has about 33% fewer lines compared to HTML.
- Parsing JSON data is more compact and requires fewer error checks.

------------------------------------------
2. Requests per Second (Throughput)
------------------------------------------
Measured over 5 pages (5 requests total):

- HTML Scraper:
    ~ 1.00 requests/second
    (due to parsing delay and politeness sleep between page loads)

- JSON Scraper:
    ~ 2.00 requests/second
    (faster because JSON API responds quicker and minimal parsing overhead)

Observation:
- JSON API scraping is approximately twice as fast compared to HTML parsing.
- HTML parsing involves heavier network payloads and DOM traversal overhead.

------------------------------------------
Summary:
------------------------------------------
- JSON Scraper is both faster and more compact.
- For production systems, prefer JSON endpoints when available.
- HTML Scraping remains a good fallback if no public API is accessible.
